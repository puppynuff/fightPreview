# For now this is going to be a terminal application.

## Application for previewing character combos in fighting games!
**This application will assume *default character positions* in the training range.**
</br>If you can, reset the range to the default spot.
</br>I will make it setup to press whats set as default reset.
</br>This application *only supports keyboard right now* at some point Ill add controller mimicking.
